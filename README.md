Arduino Based Flight Controller Running a Quadcopter
The Arduino is a flexbile system that enables quick and easy manipulation of many different electronic components such as sensors, motors, LEDs, etc. Because of this Arduinos are commonly used in DIY projects. In this case, the Arduino will be combined with an accelerometer and gyrometer to create an accuruate measurement of postition. With theses measurements, the Arduino will send signals to four motors attached to an x-frame which will in turn produce stable flight. This forms the basis for a functional quadcopter flight controller.
